# Dairy-Free CMS

A custom CMS built using the [Fat-Free Framework (F3)](https://fatfreeframework.com/) for a personal project.

Designed for speed, simplicity, and long-term maintainability, with minimal dependencies and clean backend logic.

## Stack
- PHP (Fat-Free Framework)
- MySQL backend
- Custom admin panel
- Lightweight routing and templating

## Why It's Public
This is not a polished portfolio piece — it's a real-world side project reflecting how I approach backend system design and build from the ground up. Most of my professional work is private or behind authentication, but I’ve made this repo public to give a sense of my style and thinking.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss it or see more client-facing examples.
